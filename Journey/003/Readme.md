# Create a Serverless Workflow with AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è We will use AWS Step Funcitons to automate the process of call center appliction developemnt 

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è We nee AWS Account, AWs Step Function and AWS lambda

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è (Show-Me) Create an graphic or diagram that illustrate the use-case of how this knowledge could be applied to real-world project
- ‚úçÔ∏è We will use AWS Step function to orc the process of call center and make coordinate multiple Lambda functions into flexible workflows that are easy to debug and change

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è Document your trial and errors. Share what you tried to learn and understand about the cloud topic or while completing micro-project.
- üñºÔ∏è Show as many screenshot as possible so others can experience in your cloud research.

## Try yourself

‚úçÔ∏è The process.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for Step function

### Step 2 ‚Äî Create a state machine and serverless workflow
Create more than one function,One to create a support case another to assign the case to a support representative for resolution and so on.
