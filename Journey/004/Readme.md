## Introduction
This week's challenge will explore critical concepts and services related to cloud storage, content delivery, and DNS management üîç We will also implement CICD for automated changes to your website.

## Prerequisite

AWS: Amazon S3, CloudFront, and Route 53.

## Use Case

![Day4 Diagram](https://github.com/abinshihab/100DaysofCloud/assets/22618390/32fb7d3e-fbd9-40a5-9c36-135940cca803)

Hosting a website in S3 bucket and connecting to it throuhg secur connection HTTPS protocl  


## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è I learned about securing access the static website hosted in S3 bucket using HTTPS secure connection and allow only access to cloudfront without exposed to public connection through bucket policy 


## Try yourself

‚úçÔ∏è Add a mini tutorial to encourage the reader to get started learning something new about the cloud.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Setup the bucket and make it static website.

### Step 2 ‚Äî Create AWS cloudfront

### setup 3 - Create HTTPS certificate
![Request a certificate 1](https://github.com/abinshihab/100DaysofCloud/assets/22618390/d4bcd4ba-fc79-4839-9a68-c3999864778a)

### setup 4 - Finalize the setup of CloudFront creation
